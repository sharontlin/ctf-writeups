# Task 1 - It Begins! - [Getting Started - Part 1] - (Network Traffic Analysis)Points: 50

## Intro 

You recieve a file <terrortime.pcapng> and are asked for the SHA256 hash from the APK and the registration info for two clients. The first step was to open the packet capture file in Wireshark and extract the APK and README <File->Export Objects->HTTP>. 

The README pretty clearly has the username and secret for two users. I used an online tool to get the SHA256 hash of the APK.
