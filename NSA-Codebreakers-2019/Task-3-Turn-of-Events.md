# Task 3 - Turn of Events - [Getting Started - Part 3] - (Database Analysis)Points: 50

## Intro 

You recieve a SQLite3 database <clientDB.db> and are asked for the addresses of the OAUTH (authentication) and XMPP (chat) servers. 

You can use an online SQLite3 database analyzer or your CLI - I opted for the [prettier option](https://dbhub.io) and found the chat server <chat.terrortime.app> and the auth server <register.terrortime.app>. I then proceeded to use Mac's Network Utility to traceroute the IP addresses. 

## Flags 

OAUTH: 54.197.185.236
XMPP: 54.91.5.130
