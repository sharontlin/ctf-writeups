# Postbook

### Problem

You are given a basic Facebook clone.

### Solution

There are several solutions:

- One is to use `user` and `password` to log in as a user. You can find a flag on the dashboard.
- One is changing the id for posts to find hidden posts.
- One is editing the post from another user.
- Deleting other users' posts requires an MD5 hash of their id.
- You can modify your cookie to be the cookie of another user.
